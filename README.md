o# FmClipTools
Tools for converting, modifying, and saving FileMaker Pro clipboard objects. Coded in AppleScript. 

To put these to good use, you can execute them from some keyboard-shortcut or macro tool like Keyboard Maestro, Quicksilver, etc. 
If you do that, you could add a step that performs a copy (on the currently-selected FileMaker script steps), and perhaps even a delete-and-paste afterwards, if you'd like. 

To use them without any third-party software, you can also call them from the macOS menu-bar by activating the "Scripts" menu. 
To do that: 
* Open up /Applications/Script Editor.app and go into its Preferences. 
* Activate the checkbox for "Show Script menu in menu bar"
* Switch to FileMaker
* Click the Scripts menu, then pick "Open Scripts Folder -> Open FileMaker Pro Advanced Scripts Folder"
* Put an alias to each of the Scripts into that folder.
